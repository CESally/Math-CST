##1 - The Computability Concept##

_effective procedure_ - an algo (**a procedure that can be carried out by following specific rules**)

_decidable_ - given a domain and property, _P_, over its members, can we figure out for which members _P_ is true and for which _P_ is false?

_partial function_ - function for which the value for some inputs may be undefined. Or possibly more technically, Given some (context) set, _S_, a function whose domain is a subset of _S_.

_k-place part. func._ - pf taking _k_ arguments.

_total function_ - functions which are left total, i.e. whose domain is the set under study. Both total and non-total functions are still partial functions. (similarly for _k_-place functions, to be total they must have S<sup>_k_</sup>)
